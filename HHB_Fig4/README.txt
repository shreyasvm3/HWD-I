This folder contains data files for HHB model in Fig4. of AHWD paper.

For DHK and AHWD the format of data file is:

Columns 	1 	2		3		4		5
		time	Re[x(t)]	Im[x(t)]	Re[y(t)]	Im[y(t)]

For LSC, x(t) and y(t) are in separate files. The format is:
Columns		1 	2 		3
		time	Re[x(t)]	Im[x(t)]
and same for y(t).

The mathematica notebook is used to generate the figure.
Only x(t) data is used in the paper.
