This folder contains data used to generate the probability distributions in 
Figs. 5 and 7 in the AHWD paper. For both LSC and AHWD, three temps.:
T = 1, 100 and 300 K, three coupling strenghts: eta_eff = 0.05, 0.15, 0.25, and
three times: t = 192, 640 and 1600 fs are considered.

For both LSC and AHWD the format of the data files is: 

Column 1: R (bond lenght), Column 2: P(R), prob density, column 3: Im(P(R)) -- not used.
