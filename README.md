This repository contains code for the Adiabatic Hybrid Wigner Dynamics (AHWD) method introduced in https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20493.

AHWD code for three different models: 2D Harmonic oscillators, Heavy Harmonic Bath, and Vibrational Relaxation of Morse oscillator,
details can be found in the paper. 

Also contains data to make Figs. 3-8 in the manuscript.
